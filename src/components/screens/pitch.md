What's for dinner?

The problem: 4/5 people haven't thought about dinner by 4pm in the day. 26% of all food waste is in the home because people don't plan meals properly. Every person in Ireland spends 377 euro on takeaways per year, including children. Lack of planning causes wasted food, time, and money.

The solution: Make Me A Sandwich is a meal-planning app that caters to your diet, creates a weekly meal calendar, preps and orders your shopping for you. You can go from sign up to having your week's meals planned in two minutes. Specify one or two cooking days for the week for batch cooking, save mountains of time, stress, and money, and never feel like you're compromising on your health or nutrition again.

The money: The app is free, but both supermarkets and users will each be charged a euro for every order. With 10k users placing weekly orders, that's 1m in revenue per year. There is also a premium version of the app for 5 euro per month that allows for up to 6 profiles for your meal planning, for couples, families, or co-habiters.

The team: Ruairi Hickson is COO and an established startup guy, working with two early-stage startups that were acquired by larger companies and having gone through New Frontiers with his own company. Colum MacNamee is the CEO, who brings years of experience with health, fitness, and public speaking

The ask: we're looking for investment to keep this lean operation running and to scale up so we can next address the UK market before moving into other markets.
